This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
Glink="https://github.com/543-Van-Deliverables/Deliverable-2/raw/main/"
Flink="us-states.csv"
CDD=read.csv(paste0(Glink,Flink))
```
```{r}
names(CDD)
```


```{r}
summary(CDD$deaths)
```
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
base=ggplot(data=CDD, aes(x=date, y=deaths))
base+geom_boxplot()
```
```{r}
tapply(CDD$deaths,
       CDD$date, summary)
```
```{r}
baseHY=ggplot(data=CDD, aes(x=deaths))
histHY=baseHY+geom_histogram(aes(fill=date), color='black')
histHY
```
```{r}

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
